    <p>There’s a certain exuberance inside Xfinity Pavilion when Rainelle Jones rises for a suffocating block attempt—  the middle blocker is often greeted with a cacophony of raucous applause as the ball craters back to the hardwood.</p>

    <p>Jones’ clinical blocking displays have become a staple over the course of her four seasons in College Park, as local fans have packed ‘The Pav’ for years to watch the Oxon Hill, Maryland native impose her will on the nation’s elite.</p>

    <p>“I feel like the roar of everyone is super awesome,” Jones said of the Pavilion’s rowdy attendants. “It brings [the team] up, and really brings the vibe up.”</p>

    <p>Jones, Maryland’s high-energy senior captain, has embodied the spirit of Maryland volleyball ever since she decided to represent her home state in 2018. Following a stellar senior season, Jones was named First Team All-Big Ten after leading the nation in blocks per set.</p>

    <p>Jones also leads a long line of high profile volleyball recruits with ties to the DMV area, helping to make the East Coast a hotbed for emerging talent in a rapidly growing sport. It’s an area that coach Adam Hughes has made a point to emphasize in recruiting over the course of his four seasons at the helm in College Park.</p>

    <p>“It’s important for us to have some of the best players locally who continue that path there from the DMV to UMD,” Hughes said. “That’s one of the things that we’ve been trying to make sure is that we’re a good leader in that area, trying to get young players to continue to play.”</p>

    <p>And Jones isn’t the only local kid making an impact at the Pavilion.</p>

    <p>Big Ten All-Freshman honoree Milan Gomillion hails from Bowie, Maryland, along with scrappy middle blocker Cara Lewis. Freshman setter Zoe Huang rounds out the Terps’ four local DMV products— each of whom have brought a unique skill set to Hughes’ program.</p>

    <p>For Hughes, a growing number of young athletes involved in volleyball has changed the landscape of an area teeming with potential.

    <p>“This area as a whole has grown tremendously,” Hughes said. “It’s always been a [historically] good basketball area, but I think we’re getting a lot more opportunities for young players to not just participate [in volleyball], but also to see it.”</p>

    <p>Throughout the Fall 2021 season, high school players from across the DMV area made trips to the Pavilion to witness Hughes’ program face off against some of the Big Ten’s most storied volleyball programs.</p>

    <p>Newly-signed outside hitter Laila Ivey remembers witnessing Maryland’s historic 3-2 victory over Wisconsin, sitting close by as the Terps flooded the court in triumph after a Sam Csire kill knocked off the then-No. 2 team in the country.</p>

    <p>“I went to the first game against Wisconsin which was insane,” Ivey said. “I remember coach [Hughes] telling me how he likes how the Pavilion is smaller than most volleyball gyms, so you can just pack it up and it’s just loud and the fans are cheering.”</p>

    <p>A First Team All-American outside hitter from Annapolis, Maryland, Ivey comes from the same club volleyball pipeline as each of the Terps’ four local products— Metro Volleyball Club of DC.</p>

    <p>And on November 11, less than two months after attending Maryland’s hallmark victory, Ivey put pen to paper and officially signed with Hughes’ squad on National Signing Day.</p>

    <p>“I’m just excited to grow as a player and just get stronger and move up to the next level,” Ivey said following her signing. “I’m very excited about being able to play in the Big Ten against these girls I’ve been seeing on TV.”</p>

    <p>With her signing, Ivey joined a group loaded with talent on the heels of one of its most successful seasons in recent memory. A vast majority of Hughes’ roster is expected to join Ivey at the Pavilion next Fall, with hopes of building on a year that already showed marked improvement.</p>

    <p>Jones couldn’t be more thrilled for Ivey’s arrival.</p>

    <p>“I’m glad that we have another ‘Metro to Maryland’ kind of thing, I feel like we’re definitely keeping the program in the area,” Jones said of Ivey’s signing. “The whole ‘DMV to UMD’ is still thriving, and I like that a lot.”</p>

    <p>DMV to UMD. It’s a trademark patented by Hughes, made prominent by Jones and carried on by Ivey.</p>

    <p>And with Jones hinting at a return to College Park, the duo of Ivey and Jones has the opportunity to turn heads in a loaded Big Ten.</p>
